## Introduction

Owing to the [Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/es) project, Barcelona City Council provides several datasets which are almost ready for consumption with minimal pre-processing. Among them, the tables of [travel expenses of members of the town council](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/es/dataset/viatges-govern-bcn) (excluding the mayor) by year contain information about cost, duration and destination of the travels of said members since 2019. ^[Some data preparation is necessary to correct typing errors, account for the fact that some travels are split in several legs even though they have the same accounting id, etc]

The information is organized in csv files with a record for each travel accounting id (*Numero_de registre* in the files) and expense category: travel proper (*Despla√ßament*), lodging (*Allotjament*) and other (*Altres despeses*). Each record contains the name of the member, city and country of destination, amount in euros and dates of departure and arrival.

With that in mind we are ready to start exploring the data.
